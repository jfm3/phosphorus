This is the source to the infamous Phosphorous papers!  These papers
describe a joke language "Phosphorus" in such a way that gently
lampoons the way Lispers tend to grouse about why Lisp is not more
widely used.  There are many inside jokes.

Just say `make`.

If you want to extend the joke, you must obey the following rules:

1) Do not settle on one of "Phosphorous" or "Phosphorus", but use both
   in silent error.

2) Never typeset a hyphen.  See the TeX source for commands to defeat
   hyphenation.

3) Over and above the lack of hyphenation, typography should appear
   wonky, as if some set of rules was being followed to the letter,
   yet the results are ugly.  Footnotes are good for this.
