This is the source to the infamous Phosphorous papers!  Just say
`make`.

If you want to extend the joke, you must obey the following rules:

1) Do not settle on one of "Phosphorous" or "Phosphorus", but use both
   in silent error.

2) Never typeset a hyphen.  See the TeX source for commands to defeat
   hyphenation.

3) Over and above the lack of hyphenation, typography should appear
   wonky, as if some set of rules was being followed to the letter,
   yet the results are ugly.  Footnotes are good for this.
